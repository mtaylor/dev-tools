# You can add you own steps here, the important ones are GitCheckout. Build and Run (these are required as a minimum).

# How far back in history to search
searchSize=10

# Options are Binary,ReverseLinear.
#
# Binary is more performant, but requires a fixed historic commit to set as the lower
# value which may not be far back enough (or may fail to build).  You may also bunny hop the offending commit, if the
# search space covers multiple bugs.
#
# ReverseLinear starts at the topCommit and works backwards until the Bug Monitor returns true.  At this point it will
# stop.  Takes longer than binary, but less likely to fail.
